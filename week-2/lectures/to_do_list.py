# In this assignment you are going to create a TODO app. When the app starts it should present user with the following menu:

# Press 1 to add task

# Press 2 to delete task (HARD MODE)

# Press 3 to view all tasks

# Press q to quit

# The user should only be allowed to quit when they press 'q'.

# Add Task:

# Ask the user for the 'title' and 'priority' of the task. Priority can be high, medium and low.

# Delete Task: (HARD MODE)

# Show user all the tasks along with the index number of each task. User can then enter the index number of the task to delete the task.

# View all tasks:

# Allow the user to view all the tasks in the following format:

# 1 - Wash the car - high

# 2 - Mow the lawn - low

# Store each task in a dictionary and use 'title' and 'priority' as keys of the dictionary.

# Store each dictionary inside an array. Array will represent list of tasks.

# ** HINT **

# tasks = [] # global array

# input("Enter your option")

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Process:

# Remember C.R.U.D.

# Enter new to-do
# Store to-do in list
# Display list of to-dos
# number the items when displayed
    # allows user to select item to update or delete
    # item for the to-do list is item number minus 1 (indexing from 0)

# Prioritize:
# Make a dictionary sorted by priority

# Begining dict:

    "high" : [],
    "medium" : [],
